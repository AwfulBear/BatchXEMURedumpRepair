# BatchXEMURedumpRepair

This batch script uses a port of DD for windows to fix all your Redump 
ISO's to make them compatible with XEMU.

Place dd.exe and this batch file in the directory where all the .ISO files 
are located then run the batch file. 

The fixed files will be placed in .\FixedXISOs

It will not delete the original ISO files. 

NOTE: 
Most XBOX Redumps are around 7.6 GBs. If the game you're trying to Repair 
is below 7.3 GBs, it's probably not an XBOX Redump and possibly won't work 
with XEMU or this batch file you will need to find another dump of the 
game since it was improperly dumped.

Some games that are improperly dumped may still work with CXBX but will 
not work with XEMU.

# Legal stuff
Its a batch file that includes a port of dd for windows use it how you 
please but remember to only use it for legally owned games.
